# DotPad: Accessible Textual Information for the Blind

**DotPad** is an innovative electronic tactile display designed to empower blind individuals by transforming textual information into a readily accessible format. This project aims to bridge the digital divide and unlock new avenues for education, professional development, and overall inclusion.

## Motivation

Blind and deaf individuals face significant barriers in accessing written information, often relying on cumbersome or limited methods like Braille boards. This exclusion from the vast repository of textual knowledge hinders their ability to participate fully in education, employment, and other aspects of life.

## The DotPad Solution

DotPad leverages electromagnetic actuators (or, alternatively, LEDs for visual representation) to create a dynamic tactile display that represents text as a series of raised or illuminated points. This intuitive interface allows users to explore textual information through touch or sight, providing a more efficient and engaging experience.
